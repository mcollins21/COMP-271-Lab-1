2. The difference between objects Loyola, Granville, and Throndale is their name, line, latitude, and longitude.
3. Main is able to access lat and lon even though they are private because main is placed inside of lat and lon thus still having access even though they are private.
4. Main can access city and fare without going through and instance because they are class variables and are still associated with that instance.
5. The Loyola fare is now affected.
6. The name, line, lat, and lon strings are set 
7. Relocate is setting the new lon value to the original lon.
8. ReportStatus is set to void which is not returning a user visible value.
9. Our group decided that refomatting the code in a way where the lat and lon were set up like a series of coordinates and the coordinates could be changed as a pair instead of individually.
